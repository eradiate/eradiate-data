    "Here is a brief explanation of the five major sections of this configuration dictionary:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `mode`\n",
    "\n",
    "  The `mode` section sets internal details of Eradiate's computational kernel. `RayleighSolverApp` only supports one mode, called `mono`. In this mode a monochromatic simulation is performed, which means that only one \n",
    "  wavelength is transported per ray. Additionally the `mono` mode sets the wavelength for the simulation which is used to compute the scattering parameters of the atmosphere\n",
    "- `illumination`\n",
    "\n",
    "  The `illumination` section defines the light source in the simulation. Here a `directional` light source is used, which implements light from an infinitely distant emitter, which emits light into one single direction.\n",
    "  This plugin's parameters set the emitter's direction through its zenith and azimuth angle (also known as `sun zenith angle` and `sun azimuth angle`) and its irradiance given in units of `Watts per square kilometer per nanometer`.\n",
    "- `surface`\n",
    "\n",
    "  The `surface` section sets the surface's BRDF. `RayleighSolverApp` supports two kinds of BRDF for its surface: `lambertian` and `RPV`. Here a `lambertian` surface is set, with a reflectance of 0.5.\n",
    "- `atmosphere`\n",
    "\n",
    "  The `atmosphere` section sets all necessary parameters for the rayleigh scattering. Here only the total height of the atmosphere can be set. Note that this is a homogeneous atmosphere, which means the atmospheric properties are the same everywhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `measure`\n",
    "\n",
    "  The `measure` section defines the observational parameters. Here a hemispherical measure is chosen, which means that the exiting radiance into the entire hemisphere will be recorded. The `spp` parameter defines the number\n",
    "  of samples drawn per observational direction and `zenith_res` and `azimuth_res` define the angular resolution in zenith and azimuth direction in degrees respectively.\n",
